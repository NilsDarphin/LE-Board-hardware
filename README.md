## The LEB Project

LEB is a college project which purpose is to allow you to control remotely the I/Os of a microcontroller.
The project consists of a Bluetooth low energy shield, its firmware, and an Android application.



**LEB works with the following projects :**

Repository  | Description
------------- | -------------
NilsDarphin/LEBoard_hardware      |Schematics and design of the board (Eagle files)
NilsDarphin/LEBoard_firmware      |Firmware of the board
NilsDarphin/LEB_Android           |Example of Android application

### Exemples of use

### What is it used for ?

The LEB Project allows you to develop easily Bluetooth low energy peripherals : 
Plug a LEB shield on your circuit and develop your own IOS or Android application.
You don't need to program the shield, everything is managed by the client (Smartphone, computer or smart home box...), so you have little electronic to do and no C/C++.

## The LEB Hardware

This repository contains the shield and the design of the LEB shield. You will need Eagle 6.0+ to open the files.
